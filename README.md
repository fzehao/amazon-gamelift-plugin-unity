## Overview

This repository contains the C# server SDK plugin for integration with a Unity game project. It includes two variants of the plugin:

- `Amazon GameLift Servers SDK for Unity` includes the C# server SDK only. Use this plugin to add the server SDK to your game projects
  and customize your integration. For more details, [see the README file](./GameLiftServerSDK) in the `GameLiftServerSDK` folder of this repository.
- `Amazon GameLift Servers Plugin for Unity` includes the server SDK and additional UI components for the Unity Editor. The UI components
  give you guided workflows so you can deploy your game for hosting with Amazon GameLift Servers directly from the Unity editor.
  For more details, [see the README file](./GameLiftPlugin) in the `GameLiftPlugin` folder of this repository.

Download the plugin variant that best fits your project requirements from the Releases page of this repository.

Telemetry metrics collection is supported by both plugins for comprehensive observability of your game servers. Use pre-built
Amazon Managed Grafana dashboards to monitor game server performance. For setup instructions, [see the Telemetry Metrics Guide](./TelemetryMetrics/METRICS.md).
